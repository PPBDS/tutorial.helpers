Testing for make_exercise() is a mess. This might be connected to some poor design of the function itself. But it also seems like rstudioapi functions might be problematic to test for some reason.

Combine build_html.R and build_rds.R. They are about 90% the same code. BUT FIRST CHECK the submissions_functions.R code to ensure that this would be OK.

format_tutorial is an interesting and complex function. Revisit and clean up. Or maybe the soon-to-be arrival of webr makes this pointless . . .

Is get_submissions_from_learnr_session() still necessary?

Fix return_tutorial_paths to work on windows. Or maybe use here::here()?


Instead of the code chunk trick to spit out the information and download material, maybe those should be created with new functions from tutorial.helpers. Or maybe the `includes` argument to `tutorial()` could solve this by adding this material at run time. See: https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/reference/tutorial.html The df_print option is also interesting.
