The three functions which make exercises are 98% the same. Make a new function, make_exercise(), which allows for the three possibilities. Then change addins.dcf to call the new function. BUT FIRST CHECK THAT addins.dcf allows you to connect to functions with arguments, as opposed to just function names.

Combine build_html.R and build_rds.R. They are about 90% the same code. BUT FIRST CHECK the submissions_functions.R code to ensure that this would be OK.

format_tutorial is an interesting and complex function. Revisit and clean up. Or maybe the soon-to-be arrival of webr makes this pointless . . .

Remove the label_list stuff from create_tibble_from_submissions() since it is no longer needed.

Is get_submissions_from_learnr_session() still necessary?

Add testing.
