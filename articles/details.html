<p>This document reviews some of the technical details behind the
special modifications we have made to the basic tutorial technology. It
is only of interest to those thinking of modifying the current approach.
It also includes some items worth investigating and/or fixing.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="package-locations">Package locations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-locations"></a>
</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that there are (at least) two versions of
<strong>primer.tutorials</strong> installed on your machine. In my case,
we have</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> /Users/dkane/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/library/primer.tutorials-07f29d85/R-4.2/aarch64-apple-darwin20<span class="st">"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first is the default location for packages. This is where things
go unless you do something special. The second is installed by
<code>renv</code>, which was used within the
<code>primer.tutorials</code> project. When you are working in your
<code>primer.tutorials</code> project, as you generally will, the
<code>renv</code> version of the <strong>primer.tutorials</strong>
library is what you will be using. You can check this by running
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html" class="external-link">.libPaths()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">.libPaths</span>()</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">1</span>] <span class="st">"/Users/dkane/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/library/primer.tutorials-07f29d85/R-4.2/aarch64-apple-darwin20"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>[<span class="dv">2</span>] <span class="st">"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/library"</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>Whenever you <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library()</a></code> a package, R looks through, in
order, the values returned by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html" class="external-link">.libPaths()</a></code>.
<strong>renv</strong> sets things up so that the first item is its
collection of packages. Note that these are placed in a weird location,
including a temp directory name <code>primer.tutorials-07f29d85</code>.
I am not sure how <strong>renv</strong> decided to create a new one of
these. It does not delete the old ones. In the case of major breakdowns,
deleting these directories by hand can fix things.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="yaml-and-setup-code-chunk">YAML and setup code chunk<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#yaml-and-setup-code-chunk"></a>
</h2>
<p>The top of your file should look like the text below.</p>
<p><img src="images/tutorial-rmd-beginning.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>Every tutorial must load the <strong>learnr</strong> package in order
to function. <code><a href="https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/">library(tutorial.helpers)</a></code> is always included
because it contains the file, <code>submissions_functions.R</code>,
which enables answer downloading. You may need to add other packages
which are used in your tutorial. Any such packages also need to be
included in the DESCRIPTION file.</p>
<p><code>echo = FALSE</code> is a handy default because, most of the
time, we don’t show users the code. Setting the
<code>tutorial.exercise.timelimit</code> to 60 seconds is safe, but
probably not necessary. <code>tutorial.storage</code> must be set to
<code>local</code> to ensure that user work is saved between
sessions.</p>
<p>The other 2 code chunks load in the code for the “Copy Code” button
and the Information section. <strong>Do not remove these code
chunks</strong>. The information section and the copy code button are
crucial infrastructure for the tutorial and these code chunks allow us
to implement them easily without taking too much space.</p>

<h3 id="current-process">Current Process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#current-process"></a>
</h3>
<p>This function was suggested by Preceptor for simpler user experience
in long tutorials that require pipe-building across multiple exercises.
There were 2 main options in achieving this.</p>
<p>First was to have the code of the current exercise automatically
copied to user clipboards when clicking the <code>"Run Code"</code>
button.</p>
<p>Second was to have the code of the current exercise automatically
copied and pasted to the next exercise chunk after some simplified
action.</p>
<p>After a swift response from user grrrck on this <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/learnr-clipboard-extension/107812" class="external-link">RStudio
Community Thread</a>, a clearer direction was laid out. I implemented
the answer suggested but Preceptor pointed out that a lot of
copy/pasting from the tutorial-maker’s side was required. The problem
then was how to minimize the amount of code needed to be repeatedly
copied/pasted. Since the answer suggested used actionButtons from Shiny
which had little room for customization, we thought there wasn’t a way
to know which exercise was locally close to the button.</p>
<p>Therefore, I created a second version that was a bit “brute-force” by
having arguments for the code chunks that had the actionButtons, then
reading the file itself to find those arguments and extract the labels
of the exercise. But that was still a lot of code to copy/paste and God
forbid someone wants to insert a new exercise at the beginning because
you’ll have to manually change so many exercise names that come
after.</p>
<p>Here I realized that I don’t have to use Shiny’s actionButtons and
can just use normal html buttons with trigger events that call a
javascript function, which can directly communicate with the Shiny
server, thus finally reaching the current version. Now no more
exercise-specific information needs to be specified, only the exact same
button for each exercise.</p>
<p>That means that in order to implement copy-pasting for an exercise,
you need to add the line
<code>&lt;button onclick = "transfer_code(this)"&gt;Copy previous code&lt;/button&gt;</code>
either before or after the exercise that you want to copy-paste to. This
will add a button that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/copy-button.png"><!-- --></p>
<p>The user just needs to click the button in order to copy the code
from the previous exercise into the current one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="possible-improvements">Possible Improvements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#possible-improvements"></a>
</h3>
<p>Personally, I think the current solution is very close to the ideal
solution. The only downsides being that 1) tutorial makers still have to
include something in the exercises and 2) the button would look much
better on the toolbar section of the exercise, next to
<code>"Start Over"</code> and where the “hint” would be.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of automatically copying code to clipboard
when clicking the <code>"Run Code"</code> button has yet been explored
and could offer a better solution.</p>

<h2 id="rstudio-setting-questions">RStudio setting questions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rstudio-setting-questions"></a>
</h2>
<p>In many settings, it is natural for a set up question to have three
parts. First, run a line of code that reports on the value of something.
Example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">rstudioapi</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioapi/reference/readRStudioPreference.html" class="external-link">readRStudioPreference</a></span><span class="op">(</span>name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, default <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Code failed."</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will return TRUE, which is the default value.</p>
<p>Second, change the setting. This generally won’t return anything.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">rstudioapi</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioapi/reference/writeRStudioPreference.html" class="external-link">writeRStudioPreference</a></span><span class="op">(</span>name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, value <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>See how the first was “read” and the second was “write”? Then, the
third and final step is to confirm that the change worked by re-running
the first code again.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">rstudioapi</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioapi/reference/readRStudioPreference.html" class="external-link">readRStudioPreference</a></span><span class="op">(</span>name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, default <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Code failed."</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And finish with a sentence that tells the student to notice that the
value has changed and that it is now correct. (Of course, we “monitor”
that by making them copy/paste this last command and its return from the
Console into the tutorial.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="comments-on--rbuildignore">Comments on .Rbuildignore<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comments-on--rbuildignore"></a>
</h2>
<p>For some reason, it is impossible to include comments in the
.Rbuildignore, at least by using the “#” symbol. I think the key issue
is that using <code>*</code> (or maybe a parenthesis) in a line which
begins with <code>#</code> causes trouble. Regardless, here are some
thoughts on the current version.</p>
<p>We would like to ensure that all the junk files which end up in the
<code>tutorials/*</code> directories are not included in the build. Such
files are often large. They also run the risk of messing things up in
that they might cause certain tests to pass for us but which would fail
for anyone who downloads from Github. (The .gitignore file does a
reasonable ensuring that such files do not end up on Github.)</p>
<p>The key line is:</p>
<pre><code>tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))</code></pre>
<p>This excludes everything in any subdirectory of the tutorials
directory except an <code>images</code> directory (a file named images
would also be included) or a <code>data</code> directory or a file
suffixed with “.Rmd”.</p>
<p>This entire document is in Perl-like Regex. The only significant
difference from Perl in this document is that “/” do not need to be
escaped with a “". The regex below, in plain English, matches (and so
excludes) a path which begins with the characters”tutorials/““, and
after those has any number (<em>) of characters except a ”/” ([^/]), and
after those has a ”/”, and after those does not have (?!…) either the
characters ”images” or (|) any number (</em>) of any character (.)
followed by the characters”Rmd”. If we used .* instead of defining the
character class in [^/]*, the regex would evaluate the negative
lookahead after the last “/” in the path. The files within the images
directory would then be excluded, because they do neither the characters
“images” or a string ending in “Rmd” after their last “/”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="adding-more-libraries">Adding more libraries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-more-libraries"></a>
</h2>
<p>If you are using a new library, there are several things you need to
check. First, most obviously, you should install the package within the
<code>primer.tutorials</code> directory. Second, you must use library(X)
in the setup chunk within the tutorial.Rmd itself. Third, you need to
run <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/status.html" class="external-link">renv::status()</a></code>. This should report that there is a new
package which is not part of renv.lock. Then, you will need to run
<code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/snapshot.html" class="external-link">renv::snapshot()</a></code> so that the renv.lock file is updated.
Fourth, you need to add the package to the DESCRIPTION file, in the
Imports: section. (And don’t forget the comma when you do so.) If you
don’t do this, then R CMD check might work on your computer, where
library X is already installed, but won’t work in Github actions since R
relies on the DESCRIPTION file to know which packages to install.</p>
<p>We have seen weird situations in which even doing all of the above
did not work. The required hack was to install the new package in your
main (default) library. Now, it seems weird that this would help since,
with <strong>renv</strong>, we should never be using that location. I
suspect that there is a bug involved in the interaction between R CMD
check and <strong>renv</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="revisit-use-of-functions-from-learnr">Revisit use of functions from <strong>learnr</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#revisit-use-of-functions-from-learnr"></a>
</h2>
<p>Unexported objects imported by ‘:::’ calls:
‘learnr:::get_all_state_objects’ ‘learnr:::read_request’
‘learnr:::submissions_from_state_objects’</p>
<p>Because learnr will not export the three functions which we use in
submission_functions.R, we have no choice but to use ::: in order to
access them. Doing do produces a NOTE when we run R CMD check. I find
that annoying. I tried just providing my own copies in
submission_functions.R, but that did not work. (Perhaps the problem is
that they themselves use other learnr functions which I don’t have
access to?)</p>
<p>NWL Update August 14th: In the last few days, learnr has exported the
functions, learnr::get_tutorial_state() and learnr::get_tutorial_info(),
which eliminates the need for all functions with ‘:::’. All uses of
‘:::’ has been replaced in this package.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-of-tutorials">Discussion of Tutorials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discussion-of-tutorials"></a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s discuss the six broad categories of tutorials which we might
add, especially to chapters 5 through 11.</p>
<p>First, we can just do more examples. Use different data with a
different question, but all the same steps as in the chapter itself.
Such examples will generally, like 082, do two analyses: one with all
the data (to show the truth) and one in which representativeness fails
in a way which we define, thereby showing how we can be led astray. Last
step is to compare the answers from these two approaches, thus
emphasizing the importance of humility.</p>
<p>Second, stand-alone tutorials on useful topics, like text modeling or
networks or rtweet or whatever. These could go in any chapter and would
not be restricted to having X number of parameters.</p>
<p>Third, we could cover many other model families, again perhaps not
worrying too much about whether or not they have the “right” number of
parameters. Simplest here would be other stan_glm families. That is,
show a weird data set in which the outcome variable is something that
should be fit with poisson or something, and then use family = poisson.
Goal would be to emphasize that there are many possible models.</p>
<p>Fourth, expanding on the above, we might have some machine learning
examples. After all, a machine-learning model is just a different kind
of black box, not different conceptually than a linear or logistic
model. We could fit a machine learning model on chapter 8 scenarios.
Even though there are way more than three parameters in such models,
they still can (I think!) be made to work in cases with just one input
variable.</p>
<p>Fifth, real world data science examples which do not hide the messy
complexity of the world. I guess that these would be a lot like the
overview tutorials, but with 30 minutes of data cleaning first. These
might also explicitly assume that you have done all the other tutorials
in the chapter and that, therefore, we do not need to walk you through
how to estimate a <code>stan_glm()</code> with five baby questions.
Instead, the questions would be, not really harder, but messier.</p>
<p>Sixth, tutorials about interpreting parameters. We could have one of
these in every chapter from 6 onward. These could be short! They would
only cover parameter interpretation, perhaps only using the models which
were used in the chapter.</p>
<p>Obviously, we could also combine these in various ways. Upon
reflection, we should save the machine learning examples for later
chapters in which we have several righthand side variables. Indeed, we
could have three machine learning tutorials in chapter 11.</p>

</h3>
<p>The first tutorial for each of the later chapters is easy. Just do
more or less exactly what the chapter does. Recall that, one day, we
expect to incorporate those questions directly into the chapter itself.
So, the more that it just forces students to type in the same commands
as in the chapter, the better. But, for the most part, the chapters are
not that long! There is only about one tutorial worth of material.</p>
<p>What do we do for the other 5 or so tutorials for each chapter? Good
question! Honestly, I am not sure. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The second tutorial could be very similar to the first – and,
therefore, to the chapter. Just use a different variable(s) and/or a
different tibble, but answer the same sorts of questions in the same
way.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be repetitive in the written questions. It is fine, in the
first tutorial for each chapter, to ask students to write a definition
of the Preceptor Table. Indeed, we should always have that question in
each first tutorial. But, we don’t want that question in each of the 5
tutorials for a single chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Use written questions which do require different answers
depending in the data/variable used. We can’t resuse “Define a Preceptor
Table” because that question has the same answer every time. Consider a
different question:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a paragraph which explores reasons why we should
<strong>not</strong> consider the Preceptor Table and our data set as
being drawn from the same population?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a good question, not least because it needs a different
answer for each data science problem we confront. Another good
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a paragraph explaining why, even though the data is not a
random sample, we may still consider it to be “respsentative” enough to
move forward?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this requires a different answer for each new tibble.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We don’t usually (ever?) ask questions about the four Cardinal
Virtues directly. They are simply a pedagogical device we use to help
students organize their work. But we do ask written questions about the
key concepts (population, representativeness, validity) in each and
every tutorial. These are difficult concepts with no “right” answers. We
need to wrestle with them every week.</p></li>
<li><p>A tutorial after the first might do a very similar exercise but
with three differences. First, it can go faster, given that students
have already seen the basics fairly slowly in the first tutorial.
Second, it can add some complexity, make the modeling problem just a
little more difficult than the basic case. Third, it can add some new
magic. Perhaps it grabs data using a new package instead of just using
another boring data set from <strong>primer.data</strong>. Perhaps it
creates a nicer plot with some geoms we have not used before.</p></li>
<li><p>I will distribute the problem sets we used last semester. Turning
them into tutorials might work well. But always remember that tutorials
are easy, while problem sets are hard. So, we need to split up a big
problem set question into 15 exercises and then walk the students slowly
(and with hints) through those 10 exercises.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe there are easy ways, in tutorial 2 or 3, to take the
problem we solved in tutorial 1 and have it loosen the assumption that
the data we have is representative of the population. This is a nice
assumption to loosen since it is never true. I am not sure how one would
do this . . .</p></li>
<li><p>If the main example is the chapter is one which uses a linear
model, then tutorial 2 could use a logistic model and then tutorial 3
could use the third kind of model (which we have not chosen yet).
Similarly, if the chapter (and first tutorial) does a predictive mode,
then tutorial 3 should do a causal model.</p></li>
<li><p>The last tutorial might, in some sense, try to set the stage for
the next chapter, provide a teaser for what we are learning
next.</p></li>
<li><p>Another type of tutorial is one which uses fake data which has
been manipulated to violate the assumptions which students are making.
Show them Preceptor’s Posterior and compare it to their own.</p></li>

<p><strong>install_only_binary_packages</strong> is a function that
updates the user’s .Rprofile file to only download the binary version of
packages. The reason of this function is that students are often
prompted to download from the source of the packages, which we do not
want to happen. Therefore, by changing the .Rprofile to only downloading
binary packages, students can only download from CRAN.</p>
<p>The <code>copy-code-chunk</code>, <code>info-section</code>, and
<code>download-answers</code> are <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/include-custom-code-chunks-from-separate-files/109216" class="external-link">imported</a>
into each tutorial. The actual Rmd of these sections are saved in the
<code>inst/child_documents</code> folder. Note that the
<code>setup</code> code chunk must come before all of them.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="permanent-objects">Permanent objects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#permanent-objects"></a>
</h2>
<p>Permanent objects should be avoided, if possible. The problem is that
each Exercise code chunk is its own “world.” It knows nothing of any
actions taken in previous code chunks, except for three exceptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Any objects created in the global “setup” code chunk are
available in all Exercise code chunks. The annoying thing about this
option is that we would, ideally like to have the obects created near —
in the Rmd — to the Exercises which use them. This also means that we
can only use names like “fit_1” or “pp” once in each tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects created in a setup chunk for just one exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects created in a code chunk which is then referenced by using
the exercise.setup code chunk option in any Exercise which needs access
to these objects. This is probably the best approach.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But what about regular code chunks which are neither Exercise code
chunks nor setup chunks. Do objects created there persist? Maybe!
Sometimes!? My <em>sense</em> is that such objects are available when
the tutorial is knitted. This is why we can show a plot at the end of a
Section after creating it at the start. But such objects are not
available at run time, which is why they are not seen in Exercises.</p>
<p>No aspect of the tutorials has given us more trouble than permanent
objects. In particular, it sometimes seems like things will work with
Run Document but not with Run Tutorial. Since students always do the
latter, we need to test that way as well.</p>
