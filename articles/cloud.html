<p><a href="https://posit.cloud/" class="external-link">Posit Cloud</a> is the most common
cloud service to use when working with <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" class="external-link">RStudio</a>, not least
because <a href="https://posit.co/" class="external-link">Posit</a> is also the company behind
RStudio. Using Posit Cloud with tutorials created with the <a href="https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/"><strong>tutorial.helpers</strong></a>
package is sometimes tricky. The purpose of this vignette is to explain
the process.</p>
<p>First, when signing up, choose the “<a href="https://posit.cloud/plans" class="external-link">Cloud Free</a>” plan. At least for the
first 20 hours or so of use, do not give Posit your credit card number.
If Posit Cloud is working well for you, and you use more than the 25
hours per month allowed (currently) by the Cloud Free plan, then you
might pay and upgrade. There are also sometimes discounts for
students/teachers. I</p>
<p>Second, follow the Posit Cloud <a href="https://posit.cloud/learn/guide" class="external-link">instructions</a> to login, an
action which should automatically place you in your Workspace. Once
there, set up a new RStudio Project. This is all fairly simple and just
involves clicking some buttons. Once you have a new Project, you should
be able to follow the <a href="https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/">standard
instructions</a> for working with the <strong>tutorial.helpers</strong>
package. That is, running
<code>install.packages("tutorial.helpers")</code> should work as the
first R command you issue in the Console.</p>
<p>Third, go to the Tutorial tab in the upper right corner and scroll to
the bottom. Tutorials are listed in the alphabetical order of the
packages in which they reside, so the “Getting Started with Tutorials”
tutorial is usually the bottom tutorial. Press the “Start Tutorial”
button.</p>
<p>Fourth, the “Getting Started with Tutorials” tutorial will be
created, with messages shown in the “Background Jobs” tab. After a few
moment, the tutorial will be complete, also appearing in the Tutorial
pane. You may work on it either in the Tutorial pane or, by clicking the
“Show in new window” button — located between the “Return to home” and
“Stop tutorial” buttons — in its own window. I recommend leaving it in
the Tutorial tab. Note that you can adjust the different window sizes to
give the Tutorial tab more room.</p>
<p>Fifth, once you complete the tutorial, you can download your answers.
Note that, in Posit Cloud, just pressing a download button, for any
format, will probably not work. Instead, you will need to follow the
instructions you see and use an alternative or secondary click. This is
either a two finger click (or <code>Ctrl + click</code>) on the Mac or a
right click on Windows. This action will bring up a menu, one choice of
which is “Save link as …” Choose this option and download the file,
probably to your Downloads folder. Accept the default name for the file.
An appropriate suffix will be added automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Posit Cloud shuts down unused sessions
aggressively. If you stop working on your tutorial, it will be closed
and “greyed out.” To restart it, you need to press the “Return to home”
button — the little house symbol with the red roof — and then restart
your tutorial. All your previous answers will be saved so you can just
pick up where you left off.</p>

</h3>
<p>In most tutorials, you never leave the RStudio Project in which you
started the tutorial.</p>
<p>Some tutorials require you to create a new RStudio Project. Examples
from the <strong>r4ds.tutorials</strong> package include “RStudio and
code,” RStudio and Github,” and “Quarto.” This works fine on your local
computer. On Posit Cloud, things are trickier. You must manually keep
track of the different RStudio Projects in which you are working.</p>
<p>In order to start a new RStudio Project on Posit Cloud, you must go
back to your Workspace, click on “New Project” in the upper right,
select “New Project from a Git Repository,” and then provide the URL for
your Git repo. Once you click “OK,” you will now have two RStudio
Projects in your Workspace.</p>
<p>These two projects are completely separate. They run on separate
“containers,” i.e., on separate computers with no connection to one
another. One might think that this is not a problem. We should be able
to just move back-and-forth between the two RStudio Projects, just as we
would on a local computer. But that does not work on Posit Cloud because
each time you switch away from the tutorial RStudio Project, Posit Cloud
closes the tutorial, thereby requiring you to restart it each time you
come back. That is very annoying!</p>
<p>The solution is for you to login to Posit Cloud twice, keeping each
login in its own tab on your browser. In one login, you are looking at
the tutorial RStudio Project, answering questions as you go along. In
the other login, you are looking at the second RStudio Project, which is
usually connected to a Github repo. This is where you are doing most of
your work. But, because these two logins are just two tabs on your
browser, it is easy to switch back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: On Posit Cloud (unlike on your local
computer) progress on a tutorial is not saved across RStudio Projects
That is, if you close the RStudio Project in which you have been working
on a tutorial, you will lose all the work you have done on that
tutorial.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rstudio-project-templates">RStudio Project Templates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rstudio-project-templates"></a>
</h3>
<p>One problem with working with RStudio on Posit Cloud is that each new
RStudio Project is “clean,” meaning that no packages have been installed
and any RStudio settings you may have selected in previous RStudio
Projects have disappeared. The best way to solve this is to create a <a href="https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#project-templates" class="external-link">Project
Template</a>. The idea behind templates is that you want to start new
RStudio Projects with all your favorite packages already installed, all
your preferred RStudio preferences already selected, and so on. If you
do all these things in your template, then each new RStudio Project you
create will start up with all these tasks already accomplished.</p>
