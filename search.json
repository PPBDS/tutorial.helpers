Set the \"Add a README file\" toggle box to \"On.\"  Connect the repo to a project on your computer using `File -> New Folder from Git ...`.  Make sure to select the \"Open in a new window\" box.   You need two Positron windows: this one for running the tutorial and the one you just created for writing your code and interacting with the Console.  In the new window, select `File -> New File -> Quarto Document ...`. Provide a title -- `\"XX\"` -- and an author (you). Save the file as `analysis.qmd`. Render the document.   Create a `.gitignore` file with `analysis_files` on the first line and then a blank line. Save and push.  In the Console, run:  ```          show_file(\".gitignore\") ```  If that fails, it is probably because you have not yet loaded `library(tutorial.helpers)` in the Console.

If there is more than one required library, you can just add those libraries to these steps, adjusting the grammar as needed. Or, you might have separate questions for each library, thereby providing more room for knowledge drops. --> ### Exercise 2  In your QMD, put `library(tidyverse)` in a new code chunk. Render the file using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`.  Notice that the file does not look good because the code is visible and there are annoying messages. To take care of this, add `#| message: false` to remove all the messages in this `setup` chunk. Also, add the following to the YAML header to remove all code echoes from the HTML:  ```          execute:    echo: false ```  Using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`, render the file again. Only the title and author should appear in the HTML.

Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to execute that line.  Note how this command causes `library(tidyverse)` to be copied down to the Console and then executed.

The next time you render your QMD, as long as you have not changed the code, Quarto will just load up the saved object.  If you have not done so already, you should add `analysis_cache` to the `.gitginore`. The content of the cache file does not belong on GitHub.
