\title{Open Multiple GitHub Pages in Browser Tabs}
\usage{
open_github_pages(
  urls,
  url_var = NULL,
  label_var = NULL,
  delay_seconds = 0.5,
  browser = "default",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{Either a character vector of URLs to open, OR a tibble/data.frame
containing submission data with a URL column}

\item{url_var}{Character string specifying the column name containing URLs.
Required when urls is a tibble/data.frame. Ignored when urls is a character vector.}

\item{label_var}{Character string specifying the column name to use for
identifying each submission in verbose output (e.g., "name", "email").
Only used when urls is a tibble/data.frame.}

\item{delay_seconds}{Numeric value specifying delay between opening each URL
(default is 0.5 seconds to allow browser to process each request)}

\item{browser}{Character string specifying which browser to use. Options are
"default" (system default), "chrome", "firefox", "safari", or "edge".
On Windows, also supports "msedge". Default is "default".}

\item{verbose}{Logical value (TRUE or FALSE) specifying verbosity level.
If TRUE, reports each URL as it's being opened.}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. Function is called for its side effect of opening browser tabs.
}
\description{
This function opens multiple GitHub.io pages in browser tabs, making it easy
for teaching fellows to quickly review student webpages. It can accept either
a vector of URLs or a tibble/data.frame containing URLs.
}
\details{
The function uses the system's default method to open URLs, which typically
opens them in the default browser. Most modern browsers will open multiple
URLs as tabs in the same window when called in quick succession.

The delay between opening URLs helps ensure the browser has time to process
each request properly. You may need to adjust this delay based on your
system performance and browser behavior.
