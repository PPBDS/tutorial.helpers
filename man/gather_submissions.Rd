\title{Gather Submissions}
\usage{
gather_submissions(path, title, keep_loc = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to the local directory containing the HTML/XML files, or a Google Drive folder URL.
If it's a Google Drive URL, the function will download the entire folder to a temporary directory.}

\item{title}{A character vector of patterns to match against the file names.
Each pattern is processed separately and results are combined.}

\item{keep_loc}{A character string specifying where to save downloaded files (only for Google Drive URLs).
If NULL (default), files are downloaded to a temporary directory and deleted after processing.
If specified, files are downloaded to this location and kept.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value (TRUE or FALSE) specifying verbosity level.
If TRUE, reports files that are removed during processing.}
}
\value{
A named list of tibbles, where each tibble contains the data from one HTML/XML file
that matches any of the specified patterns and has valid table structure.
}
\description{
This function finds and reads HTML/XML files from a local directory
or Google Drive folder that match specified patterns. It extracts tables from the
files and returns a list of tibbles containing the submission data.
}
\details{
Google Drive allows for more than one file with the exact same name.
If you download files manually ("by hand"), you will get both files but with
one of them automatically renamed by your browser. However, if you use the
Google Drive functionality in this function, the second file will overwrite
the first, potentially resulting in data loss.
