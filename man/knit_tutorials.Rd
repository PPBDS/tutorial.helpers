\description{
We define "testing" a tutorial as (successfully) running
\code{render()} on it. This function renders all the tutorials provided in
\code{tutorial_paths}. There is no check to see if the rendered file looks OK.
If a tutorial fails to render, then (we assume!) an error will be generated
which will then filter up to our testing rig.

  knit_tutorials(tutorial_paths = return_tutorial_paths("tutorial.helpers"))
