\title{Check Membership in List of Tibbles}
\usage{
check_membership(tibble_list, key_var, membership, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tibble_list}{A named list of tibbles, each containing an "id" column and an "answer" column}

\item{key_var}{A character string specifying the key variable to check}

\item{membership}{A character vector of allowed values for the key variable}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to report removed items (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A list of tibbles where the key variable exists and its value is in the membership list
}
\description{
This function filters a list of tibbles based on whether a key variable's value
is among the membership values. It first uses check_key_vars() to ensure the
key variable exists, then checks membership. Useful for keeping only specific
students or participants.

# Create sample data with student emails
tibble1 <- tibble(id = c("name", "email", "age"), 
                  answer = c("John", "john@student.edu", "20"))
tibble2 <- tibble(id = c("name", "email", "age"), 
                  answer = c("Jane", "jane@external.com", "22"))

tibble_list <- list("student1.html" = tibble1, "student2.html" = tibble2)
my_students <- c("john@student.edu", "mary@student.edu", "bob@student.edu")

# Keep only students with allowed emails
valid_students <- check_membership(tibble_list, "email", my_students)

# With verbose output
valid_students <- check_membership(tibble_list, "email", my_students, verbose = TRUE)
