The following function was modified from Colin Rundel's learnrhash package,
available at https://github.com/rundel/learnrhash.

This note is also modified from Professor Rundel's description: Note that
when including these functions in a learnr Rmd document it is necessary that
the server function, \code{submission_server()}, be included in an R chunk where
\code{context="server"}. Conversely, any of the ui functions, \verb{*_ui()}, must \emph{not}
be included in an R chunk with a \code{context}.
