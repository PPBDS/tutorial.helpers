## What you will learn
### 

### Exercise 1

<!-- test that it works with no exercise chunk. What should happen to this chunk label? Presumably nothing? Or should it be removed. -->

```{r what-you-will-learn-ex-1}
knitr::include_graphics("images/base.png")
```

### Exercise 2

<!-- test that things work with one hint chunk and an unlabeled test chunk. -->

```{r what-you-will-learn-ex-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r what-you-will-learn-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Exercise 3

<!-- test that things work with two hints; no test chunk -->


```{r what-you-will-learn-ex-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r what-you-will-learn-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
look it up
```

```{r what-you-will-learn-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?sqrt
```
