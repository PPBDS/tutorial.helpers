This is test 1 for the addin that formats code chunk labels. 

## Section 1
###

### Exercise 1


Purpose of this initial code chunk is to ensure format_tutorial() does not act on it. A code chunk without either "exercise," "eval," or "include" should not be changed.

```{r}

```



```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

```{r -test, include=FALSE}

```


###

### Exercise 4


```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

Testing to see if an unlabeled code chunk at the end also is unchanged, as it should be.

```{r}

```


###

### Exercise 3


```{r section-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###


### Exercise 4


```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

###

A code chunk with the label setup should not be changed:

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(learnr)
``

None of the default tutorial helpers should be changed:

```{r copy-code-chunk, child = system.file("child_documents/copy_button.Rmd", package = "tutorial.helpers")}
```

```{r info-section, child = system.file("child_documents/info_section.Rmd", package = "tutorial.helpers")}
```

```{r download-answers, child = system.file("child_documents/download_answers.Rmd", package = "tutorial.helpers")}

## Section 2
###

### Exercise 8


```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

###

### Exercise 2


```{r incorrect-label}
question_text(
	"prompt here",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Text for button",
	incorrect = NULL)
```

###

### Exercise 3

Ignore anything within a four backtick environment, including headers and code chunks.

````
### Exercise 6

```{r exercises-1, exercise = TRUE}

```
````

Also ignore data printouts:

```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

###

### Exercise 4

Don't change a chunk with the "file" option.

```{r file = "images/chunk-example.txt", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

Should work even if there are no labels, even if the comma is not included. The option tells us what kind of chunk it is, and therefor, how to label it.

```{r, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r include = FALSE}

```

```{r eval = FALSE}

```

###

## Exercises 
### 

Weird case which used to produce exercises--1 instead of exercise-1.

### Exercise 1

```{r exercises-1, exercise = TRUE}

```
