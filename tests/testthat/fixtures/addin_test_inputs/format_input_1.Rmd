This is test 1 for the addin that formats code chunk labels. This covers the basic usage of the addin, which is changing the chunk labels based on section name and exercise number. It also covers the mix of different kinds of questions.

## Section 1
###

### Exercise 1

Purpose of this initial code chunk is to ensure that format tutorial does not act on it. No code chunk without a label should be changed.

```{r}

```



```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

```{r -test, include=FALSE}

```


###

### Exercise 2


```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```

Testing to see if an unlabeled code chunk at the end also is unchanged, as it should be.

```{r}

```


###

### Exercise 3


```{r section-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 4


```{r incorrect-label, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r incorrect-label, eval = FALSE}

```
