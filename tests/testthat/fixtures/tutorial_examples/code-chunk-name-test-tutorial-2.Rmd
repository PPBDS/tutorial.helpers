### 

[**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) and [**wrirexl**](https://docs.ropensci.org/writexl/) are the two key packages for working with Excel spreadsheets.

### Exercise 1

Use the `library()` command to load the **readxl** package.


```{r really-long-name-to--1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r really-long-name-to--1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

### 

“[Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)” by Karl Broman and Kara Woo provides lots of great advice for organizing your data using spreadsheets.

### Exercise 2

Look up the help page for the package by issuing this command: "?`readxl-package`". Copy/paste the Description field from the help page.  

```{r really-long-name-to--2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

Almost all packages have a help page which can be accessed via `packagename-package`. Note that you need to use backticks (\` \`) around this phrase after the `?` because otherwise the Console will try to interpret the dash as a minus sign, thereby sending you to the wrong page.

### Exercise 3

Run `read_excel()` with `"data/students.xlsx"` as the argument to `path`.


```{r really-long-name-to--3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r really-long-name-to--3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_excel(path = "...")
```

### 

`read_excel()` functions similarly to `read_csv()` and the other data import functions you have seen before. The **readxl** package also includes `read_xls()` (for files in xls format) and `read_xlsx()` (for files in xlsx format). `read_excel()` can read files with both xls and xlsx format. It guesses the file type based on the input.


```{r download-answers, child = system.file("child_documents/download_answers.Rmd", package = "tutorial.helpers")}
```
