  # This used to cause an error when running devtools:test(). That was annoying

  # devtools::check() works because it builds and installs the package temporarily
  # devtools::test() runs tests in the development environment where inst/ files aren't in their installed locations
  
  # It then suggested this new approach. It "works" but I haven't 
  # confirmed that, when using devtools::check(, it is actually testing anything . . .

  # in the test environment without full installation
