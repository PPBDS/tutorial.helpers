# This script tests the components of the downloading functions for
# submission_server()

# Main problem with current submission tests is that it is not tested with a
# saved session, instead it uses "test modes" of the functions, which bypasses
# the use of sessions.

# The problem with sessions seem to only occur in Github Actions because using
# devtools::check() on the package locally does not raise any errors with the
# submission test.

# It is also not a problem with storage location in Github Actions because the
# session object is loaded where all of its attributes such as
# session$options$appDir are accessible. However only when used in
# environment-related instances does it raise errors in Github Actions.

# the get_submissions_from_learnr_session() function currently uses
# learnr:::get_all_state_objects(),
# which uses learnr:::get_objects(),
# which uses learnr:::read_request()

# learnr:::read_request() is a special function because it interacts directly
# with the shiny session environment. I suspect that the problem is caused by
# the session_save.rds not preserving the environment of the session.

# Check here for the definition of learnr:::read_request()
# https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/blob/master/R/identifiers.R
