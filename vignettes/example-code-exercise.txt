### Exercise 2

Start your code with `cces`. Use the pipe operator `|>` to add the 
function `filter()`, selecting the  rows where `state` is equal to 
"Massachusetts". To set something equal to a value in `filter()` 
use two equal signs: `==`.

```{r filter-2, exercise = TRUE}
```

```{r filter-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
cces |> 
  filter(state == "...")
```

```{r filter-2-test, include = FALSE}
cces |> 
  filter(state == "Massachusetts")
```
### 

`==` is used because it is **checking** whether the value of the 
variable on the left is equal to the value on the left. See 
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Comparison.html) 
for discussion of other relational operators in R.
A single equation symbol, `=`, is used to set something equal to 
something else.
