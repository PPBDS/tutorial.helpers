### Introduction

AI changes everything.

This document describes the best way to write R tutorials which embrace the student use of AI. Prior to the rise of AI, [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20251008195459/https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/instructions.html) [was](https://web.archive.org/web/20251008195807/https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/books.html) the best way to write tutorials. Our purpose is no longer to teach students how to code. 

> *Our purpose is to teach students how to use AI to create.* 

The [**tutorial.helpers**](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/) package will help you to create good tutorials. Make sure that you are using the latest development version. Install it with `pak::pak(PPBDS/tutorial.helpers)`.

### Overview

To create a new tutorial, you first need a new directory, located in the `inst/tutorials` directory of your package. Create that directory and then move to it with `setwd()`. Then, run:

```
> rmarkdown::draft("tutorial.Rmd", 
                  template = "tutorial_template", 
                  package = "tutorial.helpers",
                  edit = TRUE)
```

AI tutorials begin with an *Introduction* which provides a summary of the key packages/functions which the tutorial will cover. The Introduction continues with a series of exercises which set up the repo/project/QMD in which most of the tutorial will be completed.

After the Introduction, there are 1 or 2 sections --- the official **learnr** nomenclature is *Topics* --- which are the meat of the tutorial. 

The last section is the *Summary*. It starts with the same overview with which the Introduction began, but in the past tense. It then has a couple exercises which finish up the tutorial by using `quarto publish gh-pages analysis.qmd` to create a webpage featuring the cool plots which the student has created. The URL for this new webpage is usually the answer to the last exercise in Summary, thereby completing the tutorial.

Anytime you ask a student to execute something in the Console, you confirm that they have done so with CP/CR, the abbreviation for **C**opy/**P**aste the **C**ommand/**R**esponse.

[**tutorial.helpers**](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/) includes two particularly helpful functions: `make_exercise()` and `check_current_tutorial()`. Use `make_exercise()` to add a new exercise to the current tutorial. It will number the exercise, and the code chunk labels, automatically. Use `check_current_tutorial()` to renumber all the exercises and relabel the code chunks. This is especially useful if you add or delete an exercise in the middle of a section.

Students always need more practice working in a Quarto document (the QMD) and the Console at the same time. Good data scientists go back and forth between these two modes, writing something in the QMD, executing it in the Console, editing the QMD, executing again, and so on. We need to force students to do that more often.

### Tutorial Introduction

Students need some background in order to complete these sorts of tutorials, some familiarity with R, GitHub and so on. Students should have completed the "Getting Started" and "Introduction to R" tutorials from the [**tutorial.helpers**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tutorial.helpers) package. They should also complete the first four Positron tutorials (i.e., through "Positron and GitHub Introduction") from [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/).

Always begin by having students set up a repo and a Quarto document to work in. Again, you must replace `XX` with something sensible and usually different from the other `XX`'s. So, in the below example, the name of the repo and the title of the QMD will be different even though we hold their places with `XX` in both cases.

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 1

Create a Github repo called `XX`. Set the "Add a README file" toggle box to "On."

Connect the repo to a project on your computer using `File -> New Folder from Git ...`.  Make sure to select the "Open in a new window" box. 

You need two Positron windows: this one for running the tutorial and the one you just created for writing your code and interacting with the Console.

In the new window, select `File -> New File -> Quarto Document ...`. Provide a title -- `"XX"` -- and an author (you). Save the file as `analysis.qmd`. Render the document. 

Create a `.gitignore` file with `analysis_files` on the first line and then a blank line. Save and push.

In the Console, run:

```         
show_file(".gitignore")
```

If that fails, it is probably because you have not yet loaded `library(tutorial.helpers)` in the Console.

CP/CR.

```{r introduction-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->

<!-- XX: By default, the next two questions just mention tidyverse. If there is more than one required library, you can just add those libraries to these steps, adjusting the grammar as needed. Or, you might have separate questions for each library, thereby providing more room for knowledge drops. -->
````

Feel free to copy/paste this question as-is, replacing `XX` with whatever makes sense for your assignment. That is, you need to provide your own repo name, Quarto document title and so on. The repo name should be descriptive and also not likely to have conflicts with other repos in the students GitHub account, i.e., `golf-scores` not `project-1`. 

You do not need to use `analysis.qmd` as the name of the QMD file which the student creates. But using the same name doesn't hurt anything and is convenient since it decreases the number of things which the tutorial author needs to change.

You are, obviously, responsible for adding a knowledge drop which teaches the students something about the larger topic. The most important things to mention are useful packages and functions.

The second question in the Introduction is usually:

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 2

In your QMD, put `library(tidyverse)` in a new code chunk. Render the file using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`.

Notice that the file does not look good because the code is visible and there are annoying messages. To take care of this, add `#| message: false` to remove all the messages in this `setup` chunk. Also, add the following to the YAML header to remove all code echoes from the HTML:

```         
execute: 
  echo: false
```

Using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`, render the file again. Only the title and author should appear in the HTML.

In the Console, run:

```         
show_file("analysis.qmd", chunk = "Last")
```

CP/CR.

```{r introduction-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````

The third question generally loads the **tidyverse** library into the Console:

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 3

Place your cursor in the QMD file on the `library(tidyverse)` line. Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to execute that line.

Note how this command causes `library(tidyverse)` to be copied down to the Console and then executed. 

CP/CR.

```{r introduction-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````

If the target audience for the tutorial is more experienced, you can be less didactic, leaving out several of these instructions. You could also add more steps, like loading more libraries at once.

I recommend offering these explicit instructions in every tutorial. First, students need lots of practice. Second, each time you tell them to add something to the QMD, you give yourself an opportunity for a knowledge drop. The same applies when you tell students to execute, in the Console, a new addition to the QMD. 

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 4

<!-- XX: Delete this question if you do not make use of a `data` directory in this tutorial. Note the extra spaces after the command. These are needed to ensure separate lines for each command when students copy/paste. -->

From the Console, run these three commands:

`getwd()`  
`dir.create("data")`  
`list.files()`  

This will create a `data` directory in your project. This is a good place to store any data that you are working with.

CP/CR.

```{r introduction-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

###

You answer should look something like this, although your path will be different.

````
> getwd()
[1] "/Users/dkane/Desktop/projects/xx"
> dir.create("data")
> list.files()
 [1] "analysis_files" "analysis.html"  "analysis.qmd"   "data"           "README.md"  
>
````

<!-- XX: If you have downloaded some data, then you might want to create the tibbles that you will use here. (Of course, you also need to create those tibbles in the setup chunk so that any test code which create will run.) -->
````

### Tutorial Topics

You will probably have one or two Topics, in between the Introduction and Summary. Any tutorial which both uses a lot of AI and is supposed to take an hour or so will only have, at most, two Topics. 


````{verbatim}
## XX: First topic (use sentence case)
###

<!-- XX: Mention the packages/functions which you plan on covering in this Topic. Not everything mentioned here is specified in the Introduction/Summary, but everything in Introduction/Summary is referenced in one of these topic introductions, the space before Exercise 1 in each topic. -->
````

If you are downloading some data, the natural place to do so is in the first exercise of a Section.

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 1

<!-- XX: In this question, "XX" is the full name of the file, like "cheeses.xlsx". -->

We begin by downloading XX directly from GitHub to the `data` directory using `download.file()`. 

In the Console, run:

```         
download.file(
  "https://github.com/PPBDS/ai.tutorials/raw/refs/heads/main/inst/tutorials/r4ds-2/data/cheeses.xlsx",
  destfile = "data/XX"
)
```

CP/CR.

```{r cheese-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 8)
```

###

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````


The meat of a Topic generally involves asking AI to create a pipe which accomplishes some goal. The end of a Topic always finishes up with a plot. The last four questions set up and then guide the student to creating that plot. If you want the student to mimic a plot, you can place it in the `images` subdirectory and then use `knitr::include_graphics("images/plot.png")` to show it to students.


To teach students about topic X, we first need to decide the final destination. What do we want students to be able to do on their own after completing the tutorial? For us, this will almost always be a plot. Having envisioned this goal, we need to create a "path" which students can use to reach that goal, first under our supervision and, second, on their own. The path will consist of several stepping stones, or stops along the way.

<!-- DK: We should insert some discussion about creating a bunch of different pipes. The below is an OK start for this discussion. Add a code example . . . -->

To ensure that students are on the right path with their code, we need to provide them with our code that is verified to be correct. Although we should not tell students to replace their code with ours at every step, if a student is lost, they should be able to refer to our code to get back on track. We also want to include our code in test chunks, both to show students and to confirm that it works. 

Consider this example:

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 6

Using your favorite AI, prompt it to generate R code that ... Add the code to your QMD in a new chunk. Place your cursor on the first line of the code and run `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`.

In the Console, run:

```         
show_file("analysis.qmd", chunk = "Last")
```

CP/CR.

```{r something-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

###

```{r, echo = TRUE}
XX: Insert our excellent code, probably made with the help of AI but also "cleaned up" so that it is concise and provides an excellent example for students to mimic.
```

### 

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````

The R chunk with `echo = TRUE` allows the students to see the code we have written within it. This makes it easy for the students to copy and paste our code if they need to. 

Since `eval = TRUE` is the default argument in an R chunk, the code within will automatically be run as well. Students will be able to see any output from the code, which can be helpful if the code plots a graph. If it is inappropriate or unnecessary to include the output of the code, just set `eval = FALSE` explicitly.

In that case, the answer chunk would look like:

````{verbatim}
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

```
````



### Plotting Questions

Plotting exercises are generally handled with a sequence of four questions. Prior to these, the tutorial will probably have the student practice gathering, organizing, and cleaning the data. 

The first of the three prior questions tells the student to replace the current pipe which they have in the QMD with our code. We check that they have done so with `show_file()`. The purpose of this question is to ensure that the student's data will match our data.

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 3

Before creating a plot, we need to ensure that your data matches our data. In the QMD, replace your code from the previous exercise with our code.

In the Console, run:

```         
show_file("analysis.qmd", chunk = "Last")
```

CP/CR.

```{r xx-first-section-use-sentence-case-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````

Note that the numbering of theses questions is arbitrary. Just run `check_current_tutorial()` to fix it.

The second question tells the student to, in the QMD, assign the result of the pipe to a new variable, often `x`. We then tell the student to `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` this code so that the workspace includes a copy of `x`. 

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 4

Within the latest code chunk, add the option: `#| cache: true`. Assign the result of the pipe to `x`. 

`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`. By including `#| cache: true` you cause Quarto to cache the results of the chunk. The next time you render your QMD, as long as you have not changed the code, Quarto will just load up the saved object.

If you have not done so already, you should add `analysis_cache` to the `.gitginore`. The content of the cache file does not belong on GitHub.

Place your cursor on the line where the pipe is assigned to `x`, run `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`, thus ensuring that the workspace also includes a copy of `x`.

CP/CR.

```{r xx-first-section-use-sentence-case-4}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 8)
```

###

Our code:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# x <- ... where the ellipsis are replaced with the code which creates x.
```

###

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````

Note that we need `x` to be created in the QMD, not just in the Console, because later chunks will use `x` to create the plot.

The third question tells the student to type `x` in the Console, followed by "CP/CR." The purpose is both to have the student look at the tibble and also to set the stage for the actual graphics question. In defining `x`, you should probably require that the students keep only a reasonable number of variables.

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 5

Within the Console, type `x`, which we previously assigned to a pipe and ran in the Console. Hit `Enter`.

CP/CR.

```{r xx-first-section-use-sentence-case-5}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 8)
```

###

Our code:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# x
```

###

<!-- XX: Insert a knowledge drop related to this project. -->
````

This also reminds students that they will often need to tell AI the variables in `x`, most easily by just copy/pasting the top of `x` into the AI interface.

Could these questions be combined into one? Probably. But spreading things has two advantages. First, it ensures that even the weaker students do not get lost. Second, it provides us with more opportunities to drop some knowledge. 

Now, we can move on to the plotting question. In the age of AI, students will have AI write code for their plot. They will do that while specifying that their data is `x` from earlier. The student will add their new code to a new code cell, and we check that they have done so with `show_file()`. The purpose of this question is to ensure that the student has generated their own code, albeit with AI help.

````{verbatim}
### Exercise 6

Ask AI to generate R code that uses `x` to plot a basic graph showing XX ... Mention you want to use the data from `x` and copy/paste the `x` you ran in the Console with the resulting tibble. You only need the top 3 lines, mainly to include column names.

Within `labs()`, edit or add a proper title, subtitle, and caption. If axis labels would be useful, add them, but if unnecessary, don't bother. Don't assign the code for the plot to any variable. Put the plot code in a new code chunk. Run `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K` to ensure that everything works. Make your plot look nice.

In the Console, run:

```         
show_file("analysis.qmd", chunk = "Last")
```

CP/CR.

```{r xx-first-section-use-sentence-case-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 12)
```

###

Our code:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# XX: Make sure your plotting code is good! This will take some time. You had better have a subtitle which provides the take-away message of the plot. AI sometimes gives you too much code, lots of `theme()` stuff and so on. This is no good! In most cases, we are happy with concise, straightforward code. 
```

### Tutorial Summary

Once you have completed one or two Topics, it is time for the Summary section.

````{verbatim}
## Summary

### Exercise 1

`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K` to ensure that everything works.  The resulting HTML page should be attractive, showing clean versions of your plot(s).

At the Console, run:

```
show_file("analysis.qmd")
```

CP/CR.

```{r summary-1}

````

In the age of AI, the purpose of a tutorial is to teach students how to create with AI. We do that by forcing them to practice, and by providing intelligent advice along the way.
