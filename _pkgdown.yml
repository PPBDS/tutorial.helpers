# Tutorials are tricky. All we really want is a reference page which we can 
# link to. pkgdown::create_tutorials() is not overly flexible. In particular,
# it seems like you must provide a url, even if you don't really have one.

# So, we need to knit the tutorial and then publish it on Shiny Apps by hitting
# the Publish/Republish button. Ensure that the resulting url matches what we
# have below.

# The source option does not seem to do anything.
